This project implements a client-server system where multiple clients can connect to a server and communicate based on a publisher-subscriber model. The server handles multiple concurrent client connections and routes messages from publishers to interested subscribers based on specified topics.

## Features

- Handles multiple concurrent client connections
- Supports publisher and subscriber roles
- Topic/subject-based message filtering
- Echoes messages from publishers to all subscribers interested in the same topic

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- POSIX-compliant operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS)
